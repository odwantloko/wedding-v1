            You could fly directly from Cape Town Internation Airport to Lanseria International airport in Pretoria and hire a car for your time in Rustenburg.
            The fastest route from Lanseria airport to Rustenburg is 1hr 22min. Flying to OR Tambo international airport is also an option but adds about 30-40 min to your journey.
